## Description 

### Functionality
Master Menu is a web application that removes many of the inconveniences of eating out and personalizes one's dining experience. It puts a digital version of restaurant menus in one place, listing each menu itemâ€™s price, rating, ingredients and a picture of the dish as well. Using the menu filter, users can input allergies/dietary restrictions, ingredient preferences, a budget limit, a rating minimum, as well as their diet, which includes pollopescetarian, pescetarian, vegetarian and vegan options. 
The application will take this information and highlight the food that match the user's personalized criteria. 
Once a user has decided on a dish, they can add it to their order and book a reservation, removing the inconvenience of waiting at the restaurant for their order to be taken and for their food to be made. 

### Development Tools
The application utilizes a FERN (Firebase, Express, React and Node.js) stack, as well as Stripe for payment processing. The application leverages Firebase authentication, allowing users to sign up and log in. The deployed website is also hosted by Firebase and menu/order information is stored and retrieved from Cloud Firestore databases. Moreover, the application uses React Router for routing between web pages, Context API for state management and Axios package as the HTTP client.
